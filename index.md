# University Computer Science Projects

### Machine Learning Based Question Answering Software
- Created a program to process a large corpus of text data and then answer user-inputed questions about the given text.
- Our team was able to answer questions by using the semantic information of the text in combination with constituency parsers, regular expression and using the NLTK Wordnet API.
- Technologies utilized: Python, nltk, numpy, scikitlearn

### Compiler
- Wrote a compiler for a C based programming language using C++
- The compiler had 5 different modules which created a string set of the program to compiler, tokenizer, abstract syntax tree, symbol table, and then using this preprocessed data it was able to compiler into an intermediate language.
- Technologies utilized: flex and bison.
